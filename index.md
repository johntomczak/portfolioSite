# Things and Stuff

Hi,

I graduated from GW with a Computer Engineering degree and moved to Houston in 2018. I had been teaching high school programming and data analytics at St. John's School in Houston but am now looking forward to joining the faculty, in a similar role, at Horace Mann School in New York. Outside the classroom, I hope to continue serving as a student advisor, coaching sports and FIRST Robotics teams, and helping students with their finance or startups clubs.

I am also studying for the CFA Level 1 exam in December, and then ideally Level 2 in June. On top of that, I will probably sit for the requisite test and apply to law school, if only to understand that path in a more concrete sense. For more information on my projects, readings, and little theories and arguments, check out my posts on the Substack link.

Previously, I spent a summer in Los Angeles working for DoubleLine, an investment manager mainly in credit securities, led the finance club in GW's business school, and interned for a member of the House on Capitol Hill.

My goal here is to be brief and introductory Therefore, once this page is final and clean, I will not be actively editing it. The real stuff will be on the links below. The idea is for the site to serve as a central repository, I guess in a sense like a "digital business card" in that it is lightweight, easy to read, and provides sources of further info.
